# Hackathon - Business Locations

## Report

[Read the Report](report.html)

## Business Types
As a team, choose one of the following business types to work on:

- A new full-service daycare center
- A new full-service car wash
- A new 24-hours gym
- A new 24-hours diner
- A new swimming pool
- A new organic food store
- A new sushi buffet

## Scoring Method

For this hackathon, you will use a scoring method that is based on a series of
20 Yes/No questions that can be applied to each candidate location. The candidate
location that has the most number of Yes's is the most viable location.

Each Yes/No question generally should take on the form of

  _Does the location have X nearby?_

where X is a feature that you think would be useful for the business to be viable.

Two examples of such questions are:
1. Does the location have _at least one McDonald's within one mile_?
1. Does the location have _at least ten businesses with 100 or more reviews within one mile_?

## Coding

Implement scoring functions and visualize how these candidate locations are
scored. The skeleton code is provided for you in [report.html](report.html).

## Grading

Each person must implement at least two questions to receive credits for this
hackathon.
